# Goal
Demonstrate capabilities of modern AI solutions to solve complex tasks in software development including:
code generation, refactoring and code migration.

On this demo Claude Code command line tool from Anthropic will be used 
and the task is to migrate the DIAL Chat application from NextJS to pure React application.

# Tasks / Prompts
## Discovery
- think hard do deep review of the code in folder ai-dial-chat, concentrate on technologies used and project structure

- analyze the architecture of the main DIAL Chat application (ai-dial-chat/apps/chat), 
concentrate on requests flow from javascript code executed in the browser to the external DIAL API, list API methods

- analyze the application features, concentrate on foundation features and features that can be added on top
```markdown
The AI DIAL Chat application has a well-defined architecture with:

  Foundation Features:

  1. Core Messaging System - Handles conversations and streaming responses using Redux
  2. Model Integration Layer - Abstract interface for interacting with different AI models
  3. Data Persistence - Storage implementation for conversations and settings
  4. Authentication Framework - NextAuth with support for multiple identity providers
  5. UI Component Architecture - React components with Next.js routing

  Extensible Features:

  1. Addon System - Attach supplementary tools to AI models
  2. Theming System - Customizable UI themes including colors and logos
  3. Custom Applications - Support for function-based applications with runtime environments
  4. Custom Visualizers - Interface for specialized rendering of specific content types
  5. Marketplace Integration - Discovery and installation of models and addons
  6. Message Attachments - Support for various attachment types (files, folders, URLs)
  7. Prompt Templates - Creation and management of reusable prompts with variables
  8. Internationalization - Multi-language support throughout the interface

  The application is designed with clear extension points and a modular architecture that allows adding capabilities without modifying core code.
```

- analyze the usage of environment variables
```markdown
The AI DIAL Chat application uses an extensive set of environment variables to configure various aspects:

  API Configuration

  - DIAL_API_HOST: Backend API host
  - DIAL_API_KEY: Authentication key
  - DIAL_API_VERSION: API version with default "2025-01-01-preview"

  Authentication

  - Multiple identity providers configured via environment variables (Auth0, Azure AD, GitLab, Google, Keycloak, etc.)
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET: Secret for NextAuth sessions
  - ADMIN_ROLE_NAMES: Admin role definition
  - Role-based access configured through environment variables

  Feature Management

  - ENABLED_FEATURES: Comma-separated list of enabled UI features
  - ENABLED_FEATURES_ROLES: JSON configuration for role-based feature access
  - Feature flags extensively used to enable/disable functionality

  UI Customization

  - App name, footer messages, announcements via environment variables
  - Theme configuration for branding
  - Custom visualizers defined through environment variables

  Model Configuration

  - Default model settings (DEFAULT_MODEL, DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE)
  - System prompts and model limitations
  - Recently used models tracking

  Security & Integration

  - Cross-origin settings via ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS
  - Storage configuration with STORAGE_TYPE
  - Embedding capabilities controlled through environment variables

  The variables are processed server-side during rendering and passed to the client as configuration. Most variables have sensible defaults with fallback mechanisms. This approach provides extensive
  customization without code changes.
```


## Migration
- Think hard to plan the migration of the major functionality of main DIAL Chat NextJS application (ai-dial-chat/apps/chat) into pure React application.
All foundation features has to be migrated except Authentication Framework and from extensible features let's migrate only Theming System and Message Attachments.
The target application should be able to run in a browser without any server-side rendering or NextJS features
but it should have an internal api layer (like /api/model) with the assumption that there is a reversed proxy to handle API requests to the external DIAL API.
Configuration should include DIAL_API_HOST, DIAL_API_KEY, DIAL_API_VERSION and DEFAULT_MODEL.
Use DIAL_API_HOST, DIAL_API_KEY, DIAL_API_VERSION only on reversed proxy level.

AI DIAL Chat Migration Plan: NextJS to React

  Architecture Changes

  - Convert to client-side only rendering (remove SSR)
  - Replace NextJS router with React Router
  - Maintain Redux/Redux-Observable for state management
  - Create proxy-compatible API client layer

  Migration Components

  Foundation Features

  1. Core Messaging System
    - Convert chat components to pure React
    - Implement streaming via fetch/WebSockets instead of SSR
    - Example: Replace next/router with react-router-dom
  2. Model Integration Layer
    - Create API services for model interactions
  // src/api/models.js
  export const getModels = () => apiClient.get('/models');
  export const sendMessage = (conversationId, message, modelId) => {
    return apiClient.post('/chat', { id: conversationId, messages: [message], model: { id: modelId } });
  };
  3. Data Storage
    - Maintain browser storage patterns
    - Add fallbacks for limited storage
    - Implement data versioning
  4. UI Components
    - Convert NextJS-specific components to React
    - Use React Router for navigation

  Selected Extensions

  1. Theming System
    - Implement via React Context
    - Convert CSS variables to CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules
  2. Message Attachments
    - Client-side file handling and downloading

  Implementation Strategy

  - Incremental migration in phases
  - Create shared API client compatible with reverse proxy setup
  - Configuration through environment variables for flexibility
  - Comprehensive testing at each phase

  The migration should preserve all core functionality while simplifying deployment by removing server-side requirements, making it easier to integrate into various hosting environments.
```


- Complete the migration according to the plan, place the code in the root of the repository (i.e. package.json should be in the root of the repository)


# Post-migration
```markdown
Following the initial migration of the AI DIAL Chat application from NextJS to React, we made several key improvements:

  1. Simplified the Reverse Proxy
    - Removed complex transformation logic from vite.config.ts
    - Created a cleaner proxy that only handles URL rewriting and authentication
    - Improved error handling and debugging in the proxy middleware
  2. Enhanced API Client Layer
    - Moved transformation logic from the backend to the frontend
    - Added data transformation functions in the API client
    - Added proper error handling and logging for API responses
    - Fixed stream handling to properly use RxJS operators
  3. Fixed Model Selection
    - Implemented proper model reference handling
    - Modified the API endpoint to include the model ID in the URL path
    - Updated the proxy to extract and use the model ID from the path
  4. Environment Configuration
    - Updated environment variable naming to use VITE_ prefix
    - Created example configuration files
    - Updated documentation to explain configuration options
  5. Stream Response Handling
    - Improved handling of streaming responses from the OpenAI API
    - Added support for different response formats
    - Enhanced error detection and reporting
  6. Package Configuration
    - Added "type": "module" to package.json to fix module loading warnings
    - Updated dependencies and configurations for better compatibility

  These changes have resulted in a more maintainable codebase with clearer separation of concerns, where the proxy focuses solely on request forwarding and authentication while the frontend handles data
  transformation.
